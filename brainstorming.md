# Tasks

- Allow reconnection by storing clientId in local storage?
  - When doing 2 players get's spell.caster is undefined
- Visibility

  - Put health next to heart
  - Way to see health for units

- Prevent units from going off board if there aren't enough players
- Waiting for player to reconnect should only change if one of the two active players leave

## Ideas

- Brad suggests more unit types

## Matt Ideas

- Spell pool (3 spells that you channel and build up over time)
- Both players share common deck to pick cards from
  - at the beginning of each turn, they are presented with 8 cards and they pick one at a time until they've each picked 3 which they can apply to spells they're summoning
- Some super powerful cards have secondary negative effects which trigger as soon as you pick them (spawns a golem on your side)
- Golems spawn randomly (not controlled by the players) (they foil your plans)
- (maybe) the more damaged your opponent is the more golums come your way (blue shell)
- Spells fire in a line

Game phases:

- Pick (both players apply "cards" to their spells (one at a time alternating))
- NPC (golems spawn and/or advance)
- Cast (players cast one at a time)
