## Ideas

What if choosing cards collected them in your inventory instead of in a pool and you could combine them at will before you cast them and they would combine in predictable ways ("Binding of Isaac" style). And you could walk around the board with the other player and choose to be verses or cooperative

- Mobs that end your turn if you get within range of them
- Taunt totem
- Spell ideas
  - sythe cleaver
  - Vanish (invisible for x number of turns) "creating separation"
- Larger board size
- Mega spells that don't combine and fill the whole pool
- Relics placed on map with aura effects
- Cusomize wizard stats
- Tile effects "burn/poison"
