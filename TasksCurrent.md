- Improve spell UI
  - How to inform users the order of operations of the spell they cast

## Brad feedback 2021-03-26

- Make game really really hard for testing
- advice: need more diversity of challenge with the enemy types than just "avboid that line"
  - a unit that summons other units (adds stimulation to the thought, more than just avoid the shape)

# Todo

- Next: Be more creative with enemies
- TODO: Fix retargeting for swap
  - If you can cast multiple times, maybe swap need not combine with others

---

- units need pathing, it's weird if they don't move at all
- Terrain (stuck units move laterally?)

## Bugs Suspected Fixed

- BUG: Sometimes it skips other players turn when one goes through the protal
- BUG: Dead player still able to cast and keeps moving????
  - Players don't resurrect AGAIN

## bugs

- Bug: Loading doesn't work if clientIds have changed reassigning clientIds
