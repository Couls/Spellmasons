## Bugs 
- Prevent mana scamming (done by queing up a new spell while another one is still casting and the mana hasn't been removed yet)
- Fix target arrow issue (allows you to select people out of range)
- Desync during ally turn (as seen in brad playthrough)
- res spell alone should prioritize targeting dead units over living
    - reproduce: miniboss standing over corpse
## Content
- Improve Bossmason behavior
    - No traps
    - No heal? or more obvious?
- Floating text for blood curse from vampire
- Sand vampire should be more than just a color reskin
- Endgame Looping

## Balance
- Improve difficulty scaling with over 4 players
    - Wow used 10man and 25man variations
    - Increase unit quantity for over 4 players?
    - Introduce tougher enemies sooner?
    - Diversity of playstyle (classes?)
