  - Smaller and more units
  - Get rid of cells  / Allow free movement
  - Cast spells with base radius
  - Cost mana for each card and the farther away you cast so there is no range limit (this allows for more strategy, more tradeoffs)
  - Never run out of cards, you're limited by mana instead (this way you don't get stuck)
  - New cards for mana, mana potions
  - Interactive environment (freeze water to walk on, ignite grass to spread fire)
  - Lots of little bad guys, some big ones
