# Quality of Life Tasks
- No spell should take more than 3 seconds (target column, target cone, target circle for example)
- pick a spell should come up after tutorial
- ui bug: healthbar text gets blurry while hovering over push
- Make an "out of range" exception for arrows
    - just warn "arrows have infinite range unless combined with other spells"
- perk list is too wide, will overlap if you have many perks
- chain + arrow should shoot multiple at the same time
- copy: Space needed in health potion copy
- mana goes negative if you kill yourself due to the subtracted mana from dying
- **Important** Esc hotkey to menu doesn't work if you're hovering a inspect unit while spawning
- "bleed" with quantity plays 2 animations
- res markers don't show if the unit is alive but will be killed and then resurrected

## UX
- Add secondary toolbars on the sides (only shown on drag)
- Add codex where you can read about spells and enemies
- (difficult to implement) show how much damage you'll take when you end your turn
- bug: you can zoom during cinematic
- bug: clickign to cancel cinematic sometimest clicks on the upgrade accidentally


## Graphics
- target columns should show circles when it adds a target
- fix opening book animation playing when you don't have to wait to cast, allow it to exit early

## UI
- fix being able to go negative mana if you queue a spell before the previous spell's mana is spent
- A way to see your perks roll
    - Animated Perk List UI
- Save files should be sorted by recency
- fix: tutorial comes up at the same time it asks you to pick a new spell
- Remove customizing magic color
- end turn "spacebar" should flicker when you're out of mana too, not just stamina

## Content
- Way to control Ally faction units, like follow me. Or go get them.
- Enemies should spawn in discrete clusters
