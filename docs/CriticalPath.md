# Critical Path
- Milestone | **Optimize game**
    - repelCircleFromLine is used for both unit crowding and wall physics and with wall physics it doesn't need a reference to underworld, that's only needed for unit crowding to make sure they don't crowd each other through walls
    - Memory Leaks: call destroy() on any Graphics object you no longer need to avoid memory leaks.
    - Stress test droplets to see how many users they can support
    - Check ImmediateModeSprites for leaks
    - Support huge numbers of mobs (100? 500? 1000?)
        - Profile and figure out where the weak points are
    - Saw slowdown with "+ Radius" * 4 then Bloat, then Slice
    - updateCameraPosition is somehow taking a long time
    - copyForPredictionUnit is slow for many units
- Milestone | **Finish Gameplay**
    - End of game scaling
    - More Perks
- Milestone | **Efficient Game Updates**
    - Move game logic to js files that live near the executable
        - This is necessary to support steam workshop mods
    - Don't obfuscate
- Milestone X | **Package as Electron App** | Planning on November 1
    - Security
        - Since I'm using electron, I should evaluate my dependencies for safety: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#security-is-everyones-responsibility
        - [Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#checklist-security-recommendations)
    - Menu for community server selector
    - Allow running local standalone server from inside app
    - Integrate Steam friends for joining the same server
- Milestone **Strech 1**
    - [Mod support](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop)
    - Server customization (like Worms Armageddon)

    - Perks | "upgrades" with some random attributes | The more dimentions you add the better!
        - % chance to get more stamina on level start
        - % chance to start level with mob on your faction
        - % chance that casting wont consume mana
        - % chance to freeze on damage
        - one time: 50/50 chance to incrase max stat or decrease it
        - make 1 random spell permanently more expensive and another permanently cheaper
        - Skill tree
        - Critical chances
        - Time challenges - beat the level in less than 3 turns
        - Make wagers - risk / reward
