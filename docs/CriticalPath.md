# Critical Path
- Major Tasks
    - Fix liquid generation
    - Make weekly videos
- Milestone | **Beta Testing**
    - Optimize game
        - setPath is constantly being called by all enemies
        - repelCircleFromLine is used for both unit crowding and wall physics and with wall physics it doesn't need a reference to underworld, that's only needed for unit crowding to make sure they don't crowd each other through walls
        - Memory Leaks: call destroy() on any Graphics object you no longer need to avoid memory leaks.
        - Stress test droplets to see how many users they can support
        - Check ImmediateModeSprites for leaks
        - Support huge numbers of mobs (100? 500? 1000?)
            - Profile and figure out where the weak points are
        - Saw slowdown with "+ Radius" * 4 then Bloat, then Slice
    - Build following
    - Make survey
    - Send out to testers
