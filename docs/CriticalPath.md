# Critical Path
- Milestone | **Optimize game**
    - repelCircleFromLine is used for both unit crowding and wall physics and with wall physics it doesn't need a reference to underworld, that's only needed for unit crowding to make sure they don't crowd each other through walls
    - Memory Leaks: call destroy() on any Graphics object you no longer need to avoid memory leaks.
    - Stress test droplets to see how many users they can support
    - Check ImmediateModeSprites for leaks
    - Support huge numbers of mobs (100? 500? 1000?)
        - Profile and figure out where the weak points are
    - Saw slowdown with "+ Radius" * 4 then Bloat, then Slice
    - updateCameraPosition is somehow taking a long time
    - copyForPredictionUnit is slow for many units
- Milestone | **Finish Gameplay**
    - End of game scaling
        - boss
        - unlocks
    - More Perks
- Milestone | **Efficient Game Updates**
    - Move game logic to js files that live near the executable
        - This is necessary to support steam workshop mods
    - Don't obfuscate
- Milestone X | **Package as Electron App** | Planning on November 1
    - Security
        - Since I'm using electron, I should evaluate my dependencies for safety: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#security-is-everyones-responsibility
