# Critical Path
- Headless server
    - Why: This will fix the networking issues
    - No input handlers
    - Support "Game Replay" by executing logged actions one at a time.
        - This will be useful for debugging or even testing
- Do gameplay refinement tasks: "Ideas 2021-12-17" (See TasksLongTerm entry)
    - Why: This adds better tradeoffs (more player creativity) and makes the game more resiliant to doomstate
- Start a following:
    - Youtube Alpha version video
- Content
    - More spells
    - More monsters
- Security
    - Since I'm using electron, I should evaluate my dependencies for safety: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#security-is-everyones-responsibility
    - [Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#checklist-security-recommendations)
- Polish
    - Add Juice
        - Animate cards
        - Some kind of visible error mechanism to show when cards don't apply
            - Don't let players cast fizzle spells (AOE or chain without damage)
            - Like if you cast "Protection" on yourself and then AOE it does nothing because there are no targets to AOE off of
            - Or if you cast cards out of order like Dicard without a card after it
    - Make executable with Electron
    - Finish all TODOs
    - Tutorial
    - Art
    - Music

    - Menus
- Publicity
    - Publish on Steamworks
