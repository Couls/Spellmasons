# Critical Path
- Milestone | **Optimize game**
    - Optimize runPredictions: especially with expanding + corpse explosion
    - repelCircleFromLine is used for both unit crowding and wall physics and with wall physics it doesn't need a reference to underworld, that's only needed for unit crowding to make sure they don't crowd each other through walls
    - Memory Leaks: call destroy() on any Graphics object you no longer need to avoid memory leaks.
    - Stress test droplets to see how many users they can support
    - Check ImmediateModeSprites for leaks
    - Support huge numbers of mobs (100? 500? 1000?)
        - Profile and figure out where the weak points are
    - Saw slowdown with "+ Radius" * 4 then Bloat, then Slice
    - updateCameraPosition is somehow taking a long time
    - copyForPredictionUnit is slow for many units
- Milestone **Strech 1**
    - Achievements
    - Mods
    - Make pickups do something when destroyed
    - Server config by host (pvp, worms armageddon style customizations)
    - Pushing units into portal should do something
    - Protection should be able to be cast on dead units to keep priest from resurrecting them
    - [Mod support](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop)
    - Server customization (like Worms Armageddon)
        - Turn time
        - Pvp mode (more factions)
    - Perks | "upgrades" with some random attributes | The more dimentions you add the better!
        - % chance to get more stamina on level start
        - % chance to start level with mob on your faction
        - % chance that casting wont consume mana
        - % chance to freeze on damage
        - one time: 50/50 chance to incrase max stat or decrease it
        - make 1 random spell permanently more expensive and another permanently cheaper
        - Skill tree
        - Critical chances
        - Time challenges - beat the level in less than 3 turns
        - Make wagers - risk / reward
            - even with the difficulty of the next level
        - pseudo class system
        - item that makes your stronger but it randomizes your spawn
