# Critical Path
- Milestone | **Trailers & Marketing**
    - Gameplay Trailer
        - Narrated like Heat Sig trailer
        - Explain why its specail (cast unlimited move unlimited)
        - Spells can stand alone, but they're better together
            - Show more complex combo
        - Water accident
    - The Release Trailer
        - Rethink next trailer
            - Needs more text explaining the concept
            - Lead with "fun"
            - Remove "dead time"
            - Less time watching the Spellmason cast over and over, just cut to the spell
            - get into the action fast
            - Communicate the big idea
        - Trailer Research - Show in moments what special about the game:
            - "Each spell affects the next" is better than the ambiguous "combine spells"
        - Trailer Research - FTL:
            - Fades in UI
            - Slow pan in of camera, swoop focus area of interest
            - Lot of variety. Biome orders: grass, factory, desert (and cinematic event), lava (with time breach event)
                - after that it cuts to title cards, then menus, then ice level, back to grass, snow, shows abilities like freeze and poison
            - Shows In game planning view
        - [Trailer Research - Spelunky 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6JVT2Sp8aQ):
            - 15 seconds in, something funny
            - you get an idea that it's a platformer right away
            - then it slows down to give you an idea of what it's like
            - title card: "Play with friends online"

    - Menu for community server selector
    - Allow running local standalone server from inside app

    - repelCircleFromLine is used for both unit crowding and wall physics and with wall physics it doesn't need a reference to underworld, that's only needed for unit crowding to make sure they don't crowd each other through walls
