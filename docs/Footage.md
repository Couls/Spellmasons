    - H.264 video and AAC audio is preferred, but we can transcode from many formats. 
    - 16:9 aspect ratio is preferred since the Steam client is optimized for widescreen, but 4:3 aspect ratio is accepted. Please note that audio will be filtered down to regular stereo when we transcode the videos.
    - Adobe Media Encoder CC to create compatible video files for Steam. The preset to use is: H.264 Video (20Mbs) with AAC Stereo Audio (192Kbps). 
    - IMPORTANT: OBS can incur lag so make sure to lower computer resolution and close other apps.
