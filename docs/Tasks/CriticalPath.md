# Critical Path
- Desync reporter - report health, position changes and use server hub as backend
- Fix pickup desync in multiplayer
- Show what mod spells come from
- Scobjo: balance mana steal

- Look into "Level Variety" recommendations in Discord
- bug: Krowbar: you can rejoin a game you've lost by changing the difficulty level


# Smaller Important Tasks
- Split doesn't work on yourself if you don't have 2x mana of split (Reported by Chase87)
- Add UI for mageType
    - Test something weird happened with the poisoner where an archer was poisoned but wasn't going to die and the glop ignored it and attacked me even tho the ally archer was closer
- i18n: Add translation for touchpad move character
- Ideas:
    - necromancer abilities (buffing non-player units)
    - spell: Teleport arrow
- Validation 7/21
    - fix: Choosing necromancer class always makes next spell fizzle because now you have too many
        - This should be fixed if you choose the necromancer class before you start - to be validated
