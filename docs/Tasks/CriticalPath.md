# Critical Path
- Desync reporter - report health, position changes and use server hub as backend
- Fix pickup desync in multiplayer
- Scobjo: balance mana steal
    - https://discord.com/channels/1032294536640200766/1032294537235812404/1132360848824877189
- Look into "Level Variety" recommendations in Discord
- Russell Feedback
    - Distinguish between low/med/high perks in UI
    - Bug: Traps don't appear until after first spell and they're always huge traps
    - Regen heals you when you press end turn
    - Priest miniboss lost miniboss status on death
    - stamina perks not good enough?
    - "Challenge maps" specifically designed to show off specific strategies
    - perk cast range should be in %
    - Regen copy "over" instead of "every"
    - Improve drown damage
    - Regen stacks increase if you keep casting even after the turns run out 101010,202020,303030
    - not obvious that deathmason can purify
    - "harvest" makes false positive prediction skulls
    - items that increase changes of obtaining certain spells
    - Spell idea: Target for next spell that is cast (includes allies)


# Smaller Important Tasks
- Split doesn't work on yourself if you don't have 2x mana of split (Reported by Chase87)
- Add UI for mageType
    - Test something weird happened with the poisoner where an archer was poisoned but wasn't going to die and the glop ignored it and attacked me even tho the ally archer was closer
- i18n: Add translation for touchpad move character
- Ideas:
    - necromancer abilities (buffing non-player units)
    - spell: Teleport arrow
- Validation 7/21
    - fix: Choosing necromancer class always makes next spell fizzle because now you have too many
        - This should be fixed if you choose the necromancer class before you start - to be validated
