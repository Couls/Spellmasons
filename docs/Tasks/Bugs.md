Howdy, I think I stumbled into an exploit. You can use **capture soul post level end** so long as there are units on the ground, IE units you control through resurrection. I was able to take resurrected units, move them around and bring them to below the hp threshold and capture 5 types. I had to "end the turn" maybe 4 times to set it all up. This was all after the level ended and it was waiting for me to walk through the portal.
- Lastly, I think it is worth mentioning that the **calamity of x unit gets y% more attack can select priests**, which have 0 attack. Thus you can select a calamity that does literally noting in certain fringe pulls. I also once got summoner attack range +x%.

**Holding the "F" key when choosing where you spawn** in a level is bugged now.  It doesn't show your cast range, and your movement trails off the screen somewhere random.  It also doesn't show if you're in range of enemy attack.  Pretty big bug, hoping it's a quick fix...
    - Prevent spawning ally from being targeted or taking any damage (such as from bloat)
    - I will only have to do this locally since spawn movements are not networked
        - Maybe spawning could just reset player stats
