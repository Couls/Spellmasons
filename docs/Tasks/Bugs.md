    pathing bug
    If you start a summon-swarm against a enemy on the opposite side of a U-path or similar, as far as I can tell its inevitable that some of the units will start to walk through the wall.
    might be tied to priest summoning some units since they are always there when I see this, but might be coincidence.
- bug: menu-UI; I still get "unable to connect" doesn't clear even after you connect in multiplayer
- bug: Enemies that will die next turn due to curses like poison shouldn't show that they will attack you next turn with attack badge
- UI: Fix order of spells in codex and inventory
