a way to make enemies that feel intelligent is to make mobs that work really well together as a group
it's much easier than making a single enemy who is on-par with the spellmason and achieves similar difficulty/challenge levels
also mobs that do not move as close as possible to the player but do other things, like the ancient rocks that stay back and harass, are a great concept
summoners are another good example of this
even though these types of enemies are not particularly intelligent they ramp up the challenge and increase the fun of problem solving by diversifying the threats the player has to face 
combined with these, a spellcaster that does a 1-2 spell combo will feel impactful, no need to make a complex archmage to rival the player
- Make Deathmason spawn in after you spawn so you can't one-shot it? @meme_man
    - or maybe have soulcruxes?
- ice wall (empty unit with `immovable` to true and ice image)
- Glass axe
- Auras or growing / moving areas on the map that do damage onEndTurn
- invincible enemy that does damage that forces you to stay mobile
- Mana expensive spell that gets stronger the more you use it (resets every level)
- Auras
    - fog of war (on branch fogOfWar)

## Unit
- Squid enemy that lives in liquid
    - DigitalVaporeon / Zed9876: Squid enemy that lives in liquid
- an enemy that dies when all it's allies are dead
- an enemy that does more damage the more alone it is
- Idea: enemy that only takes damage while in liquid
    - DigitalVaporeon
- Idea: monster that grows stronger over time

## Spell
- Explosion where the closer you are to the center, the more damage it does
- Enemies have their hp shared between them when near eachother. So you hit 4 enemies clumped together it will split the damage between all of them. @Skillo
    if you want to snipe one gotta isolate them
    Or invulnerable when grouped??
- Target Injured Enemies spell
- A way to share mana or send to friends @meme_man

Imagine u connect 10 corps or dead ennemy/summon  you summon a "bone golem" for exemple lvl 10 if you have 5 dead body it's a bone golem lvl 5 etc

## Modifier
- enigmaticbacon: Paperweight, heavyweight
    - Add mass to units
        - Some units automatically have more mass than others like bosses

## Pickup
- potion effects happen over a couple of turns, but are stronger @Skillo
- Pickup that thrusts you in a direction (may interefere with attack calculations with enemies)
