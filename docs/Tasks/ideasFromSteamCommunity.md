I would like to be able to shove bottles, barrels, and enemies through portals.  I believe shoving other players through already works, but if not, add that too please.  I would also like to have a spell component that can create connected pairs of portals that last a few turns.

dark ritual 
a 3x3 or 2x2 zone is marked with a pentagram as the ritual site. Enemies killing within this zone or corpses dragged to it will be sacrificed, instantly removing said corpse and causing some outcome. it could perhaps summon an allied creature to fight for you, provide permanent stat boosts or reward you will a unique spell. sacrificing minibosses would offer an even better bonus. 

healing waters
looks like your average pool already in game but heals instead of causing damage. Another version that provides mana when touched would also be interesting.

It would be cool to have different options to change your run before you start. I have a specific idea in mind for multiplayer: players cannot find spells that others already have.

Could include other things that make the run easier, harder or just different: 1hp only, no perks, spell costs don't go back down until level completion, one free reroll for spell selections, spell type x increased costs, spell type y reduced costs, etc.

The main idea is just to have some modifiers you can choose to change a run. If these are created it should be something you can see if you join someone else's lobby (preferably before you even join).

custom map editor: 
it would be amazing having a custom map editor where people can upload maps to the workshop and make their own campaigns

Chris:
"balance: Remove Nullify spell because it was way too powerful in the endgame (I may rethink a way to reintegrate it later)"

I've got a couple worked out thoughts on fixing its balance. Hopefully you like one of them! I believe each of these solutions addresses the problem with the previous version of Nullify but in a different way.

A) Nullify no longer works on the caster, but functions identically to before with regards to enemies and other allies

B) Nullify is split into 2 component spellcards: 
Steadfast - a spell that works like Nullify but only with regards to movement/displacement effects like Pull, Push, Displace, Repel, Vortex. 
Nullify (Stackable) - a spell that only nullifies the next forged damaging component in the same spell it is in. It has to be inside the spell combo to nullify an effect and it only nullifies 1 forged effect (ignoring Targeting components of course). Nullify will only protect against 1 single component in Stacked damages like Rend. 
So if there were Nullify - Nullify - Target:Circle - Rend - Rend - Rend, The caster would take damage from Rend as if they were only hit by a single Rend. Enemies would take damage from 3 Rends.

C) Nullify works as before, but cannot protect the caster against damage that would (if not protected) be at or above their max HP. 
I.E Nullify will protect against a single spell's damage to a caster with 60HP if and only if the damage is 59HP or less. If it is 60HP or more, Nullify fails entirely.

I have enjoyed the core game loop thus far.  The following suggestions are not in any particular order and all revolve around my experience playing the game solo.

1.  There is no way to tell in game how well I'm doing (or not).  A breakdown of runs, and the spells chosen that run would do a LOT towards enabling better spell decisions.  A leaderboard could solve this problem nicely if you could select that run and see a breakdown of how it went (Damage per level, number of times each spell was used, number of times each spell chain was used, etc etc.)  To be more complete, a sortable database of all runs.

Maybe for the later feature updates, you can add a run customizer, room sizes, enemy difficulty, stat modifiers, enemy count, etc
