- The zoom coordinates off issue between multiplayer sessions when casting
    - hit on one screen, miss on another
    - Related?  Brad cast a spell out of range, but it still triggered on my screen
- verify do subsprites persist after serialization save/load?
- How to show when a unit has the vampire modifier
- Fix host alt-tabbing issue
    - This will be fixed with standalone server
- pointInSameDirection returned true in getParametricRelation for perpendicular lines
- bug: You can spawn on a pickup such as spikes
  - couldn't reproduce
- "maximum shield" shows a bunch of times on hover if casting the spell would give them map
- TODO: Split up runPredictions so that it only checks canAttackTarget after units have moved, not every loop
    - Sync prediction units every loop is a waste too if nothing changes
        - This could be optimized so it only recalcs if a unit moves or if the cast target or cast cards change
- When players rejoin in progress game, skip character pick screen
- Maybe solved already? Pathing, see stash "pathfinding"
    - this.seed = '0.9408533248276452';
    - Somehow duplicate points are getting added to path
    - Fix optimize to consider P1 inside angle too
- bug: while messing with forcing desync, player got stuck with red shader on
- I saw deny.png on target when i did in fact have enough mana
- Figure out how to host server locally to be reached via the internet
    - [dedicated server](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6F46-9698-9682-8DB8)
- wspie: https://github.com/websockets/ws#how-to-detect-and-close-broken-connections
- Stress test upping limit for "couldn't find path in enough steps".  If it's not high enough, some units will just not move when they attempt to move to a target that is too complex to path to.
  - Maybe find a way to remove bad paths before the correct one is found?
- **Ask for audio permissions from FF?**
  - May have to trigger it by clicking on a button
- Does pathing information persist after save/load?
- Potential problem where I killed snowpack and left 2 tabs open (and left wsPie open) and my browser was really struggling to load homedepot.com
- Rachels screen was too small and the cards overlapped the grid
- "Mind control" spell, changes their faction temporarily?
- Bug: Loading doesn't work if clientIds have changed reassigning clientIds
- Rachel's Feedback
  - Slay the Spire style chests
  - Two stage levels? Pull a lever to reveal a portal
    - trap doors? Environmental interactions
      - Blow up a square to make it lava
- how to set pixi resolution?
- Heavily test auto reconnect when pie gets disconnected
  - Prevent user input while reconnecting?
  - Will it support reconnecting multiple players if the whole server goes down?
- Could I do without the external port checker and check from the current client via the external ip?
- should unit.die cause player turn to end?
  - or is it fine that this is handled after castCards?
- Should ending turn always go over the network to prevent desyncs?
- A way to change sprite without interrupting animations midway?
  - For example: This occurs when a unit dies while it's attacking
- Rachel request: Support click and drag for queued cards
- Brad request: Allow keybind customization
- What about a prisoner AI that you can unleash, or traps that you can unlease in a line
- enemies should not be able to be on the portal
- **Convert console.error(s) to Sentry.captureException?? before deployment**
- let our faction of AI go before enemy units go
- Swapping should only work with a target, not an empty spell
- quality of life: If you click on the portal and no enemies remain, then auto move there
- Refactor, card UI reconciliation algorithm is slow
- Swap can have unexpected effects if the aoe swap targets overlap with the caster original location, units may end up in an unexpected position, need batching to solve this
- How do players know what their upgrades are
- why do we keep accidentally ending our turns (force of habit with spacebar being used in auto chess?)
- You get "cannot move more than once per turn" while spell animations are firing
- Celebratory damage counter for huge combos!
- Event manager for granting dark card when you slay ally
- Bug: Verified, when I alt tab it desyncs
- Fix sometimes Game.playerTurnIndex is out of sync
  - Maybe this happened because I was alt-tabbed when he took his turn
- Fix replay?
  - This should be easy now that onDataQueue has been restored
- Taunt totem
- Tile effects
  - Lava
  - Tree
  - Burn
  - Poison
- Add "Dark" cards for killing an ally
  - Sacrifice
