- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Just shielded unit died when i cast one hurt on him (he  already had one shield that I worked through before)
- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Loading screen doesn't appear between levels
- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Bug: I only have 6 toolbar slots showing up (empty ones don't show)
    - and when I got bitten by a vampire it didn't add "bite" to a new slot (only to my inventory)
- DON'T PREMATURELY OPTIMIZE.  BACKLOG THIS. Refactor castCards to target unit Ids over the network instead of positions to reduce desync issues. Maybe play all targeting cards and THEN send the CAST message?  But what if they are mixed in? not sure how to handle this.  Maybe the cast message sends the effect of the cast (e.g. poison this guy, push this guy from here to here, set this guy's health to this, etc, rather than the cards).
- Ensure trap pickups work after load, they probably done
- The zoom coordinates off issue between multiplayer sessions when casting
    - hit on one screen, miss on another
    - Related?  Brad cast a spell out of range, but it still triggered on my screen
- verify do subsprites persist after serialization save/load?

    - This will be fixed with standalone server
- pointInSameDirection returned true in getParametricRelation for perpendicular lines
- bug: You can spawn on a pickup such as spikes
  - couldn't reproduce
- "maximum shield" shows a bunch of times on hover if casting the spell would give them map
- TODO: Split up runPredictions so that it only checks canAttackTarget after units have moved, not every loop
    - Sync prediction units every loop is a waste too if nothing changes
        - This could be optimized so it only recalcs if a unit moves or if the cast target or cast cards change
- When players rejoin in progress game, skip character pick screen
- Maybe solved already? Pathing, see stash "pathfinding"
    - this.seed = '0.9408533248276452';
    - Somehow duplicate points are getting added to path
    - Fix optimize to consider P1 inside angle too
- bug: while messing with forcing desync, player got stuck with red shader on
- I saw deny.png on target when i did in fact have enough mana
- Figure out how to host server locally to be reached via the internet
    - [dedicated server](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6F46-9698-9682-8DB8)
- wspie: https://github.com/websockets/ws#how-to-detect-and-close-broken-connections
- Stress test upping limit for "couldn't find path in enough steps".  If it's not high enough, some units will just not move when they attempt to move to a target that is too complex to path to.
  - Maybe find a way to remove bad paths before the correct one is found?
- **Ask for audio permissions from FF?**
  - May have to trigger it by clicking on a button

- should unit.die cause player turn to end?
  - or is it fine that this is handled after castCards?
- Should ending turn always go over the network to prevent desyncs?
- A way to change sprite without interrupting animations midway?
  - For example: This occurs when a unit dies while it's attacking
- Rachel request: Support click and drag for queued cards
- Brad request: Allow keybind customization
- What about a prisoner AI that you can unleash, or traps that you can unlease in a line
- enemies should not be able to be on the portal
- **Convert console.error(s) to Sentry.captureException?? before deployment**
- let our faction of AI go before enemy units go
- Swapping should only work with a target, not an empty spell
- quality of life: If you click on the portal and no enemies remain, then auto move there
- Refactor, card UI reconciliation algorithm is slow
- Swap can have unexpected effects if the aoe swap targets overlap with the caster original location, units may end up in an unexpected position, need batching to solve this
