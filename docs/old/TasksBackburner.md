## feedback might be won't do:
    - hoisting might not be desireable, what if you want to push then AOE?
    - Colin Direct Feedback:
        - some enemies chould shoot walls to blow yoru cover

        - QWERTASDFG for hotkeys
        - More exciting if archers had a % chance based on distance
        - physics based env:
            - drop corpse in lave and have it shoot out lava
            - bloat gore schrapnel
                - gore ended up on other characters
                - gore on them from being next to explosion
                - gore on walls, leave a mark
                    - blood trail
        - fog of war
        - what if no agro until you got close so you can't just wait for them all to come to you
        - archer arroes hurt allies as it passes through. % chance. multiple types of archers
- Lochlan feedback
    - ding sound design when "leveling up"
    - purified vampires shouldn't spread bloodcurse
    - bloodcurse show as 18+18/36
- Brad feedback
    - Add a glow on hover to spells in spellbook
    - Ambiance, particles around the map
    - precast animations, when you hover over a corpse with resurrect, white particles should come up from the ground
- Pack 9 | R, J & E feedback
    - No stamina bar after portal
    - Freeze spell should stop timer on pickups (or just increase it by 1)

- Particle engine
    - add pixelated filter, see stash
    - OR use a pixelated source image instead of a pixelated filter
    - It's the framerate that makes it jarring
- Standalone Server
    - Add "preparing" animation used to reduce desyncs due to network latency, so that if multiple users are casting spells at the same time, the wizard bending down to "charge" as soon as the current user clicks, masks a delay to make sure it doesn't conflict with other spells.  It'll send the spell over the network as soon as the user clicks but waits to cast it so that there aren't conflicting spells making desyncs on multiple clients.
    - Server should be able to send syncs that will wait to execute until turn changes so it doesn't interrupt animations and mess up the state when it syncs
- how to attach priest spell hit animation to moving ally?
- Finish force movement refactor (see stash)
    - When they stop when they hit walls they need to stop hard, not slid into them
    - They go too far into walls
    - take damage when hitting walls (add blood splatter) 
- bug: AOE is giving me "no target" when I click on ground (hurtx4,aoe,hurt)
    - rather than "no target" maybe it just doesn't use mana and shows a fizzle animation?
    - It's giving "no target" because of the first hurt
- bug: push doesn't go as far as expected if CPU is slowed down
- Don't let RMB movement interrupt cast animation
- Investigate webgl context was lost
- Fix: bad-pathing.mkv in videos folder
    - seed: 0.6450583331398443
- priest is attacking /dealing damage to him but he's not a vamp. how?
- bug: Game didn't go to game over when i died by walking into spikes
  - Implement better game over handling. be careful to not trigger game over too early. for example: A units spell might resurrect itself after dying
- dad assumed vampire bite would deal damage
  - resolved with new wording? ask
- Loch feedback: Show all the places you could move by sample size. and shade in an area
- Controls could show on escape menu instead of always
- TODO: Clean: Remove old onMoveEvents? Not used anymore
- Add "modifier" label to spells that are modifiers like "explode / bloat" and blue outline
- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Just shielded unit died when i cast one hurt on him (he  already had one shield that I worked through before)
- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Loading screen doesn't appear between levels
- (COULDN"T REPRODUCE) Bug: I only have 6 toolbar slots showing up (empty ones don't show)
    - and when I got bitten by a vampire it didn't add "bite" to a new slot (only to my inventory)
- DON'T PREMATURELY OPTIMIZE.  BACKLOG THIS. Refactor castCards to target unit Ids over the network instead of positions to reduce desync issues. Maybe play all targeting cards and THEN send the CAST message?  But what if they are mixed in? not sure how to handle this.  Maybe the cast message sends the effect of the cast (e.g. poison this guy, push this guy from here to here, set this guy's health to this, etc, rather than the cards).
- Ensure trap pickups work after load, they probably done
- The zoom coordinates off issue between multiplayer sessions when casting
    - hit on one screen, miss on another
    - Related?  Brad cast a spell out of range, but it still triggered on my screen
- verify do subsprites persist after serialization save/load?
- How to show when a unit has the vampire modifier
- Fix host alt-tabbing issue
    - This will be fixed with standalone server
- pointInSameDirection returned true in getParametricRelation for perpendicular lines
- bug: You can spawn on a pickup such as spikes
  - couldn't reproduce
- "maximum shield" shows a bunch of times on hover if casting the spell would give them map
- TODO: Split up runPredictions so that it only checks canAttackTarget after units have moved, not every loop
    - Sync prediction units every loop is a waste too if nothing changes
        - This could be optimized so it only recalcs if a unit moves or if the cast target or cast cards change
- When players rejoin in progress game, skip character pick screen
- Maybe solved already? Pathing, see stash "pathfinding"
    - this.seed = '0.9408533248276452';
    - Somehow duplicate points are getting added to path
    - Fix optimize to consider P1 inside angle too
- bug: while messing with forcing desync, player got stuck with red shader on
- I saw deny.png on target when i did in fact have enough mana
- Figure out how to host server locally to be reached via the internet
    - [dedicated server](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6F46-9698-9682-8DB8)
- wspie: https://github.com/websockets/ws#how-to-detect-and-close-broken-connections
- Stress test upping limit for "couldn't find path in enough steps".  If it's not high enough, some units will just not move when they attempt to move to a target that is too complex to path to.
  - Maybe find a way to remove bad paths before the correct one is found?
- **Ask for audio permissions from FF?**
  - May have to trigger it by clicking on a button
- Does pathing information persist after save/load?
- Potential problem where I killed snowpack and left 2 tabs open (and left wsPie open) and my browser was really struggling to load homedepot.com
- Rachels screen was too small and the cards overlapped the grid
- "Mind control" spell, changes their faction temporarily?

    - trap doors? Environmental interactions
      - Blow up a square to make it lava
- how to set pixi resolution?
- Heavily test auto reconnect when pie gets disconnected
  - Prevent user input while reconnecting?
  - Will it support reconnecting multiple players if the whole server goes down?
- Could I do without the external port checker and check from the current client via the external ip?
- should unit.die cause player turn to end?
  - or is it fine that this is handled after castCards?
- Should ending turn always go over the network to prevent desyncs?
- A way to change sprite without interrupting animations midway?
  - For example: This occurs when a unit dies while it's attacking
- Rachel request: Support click and drag for queued cards
- Brad request: Allow keybind customization
- What about a prisoner AI that you can unleash, or traps that you can unlease in a line
- enemies should not be able to be on the portal
- **Convert console.error(s) to Sentry.captureException?? before deployment**
- let our faction of AI go before enemy units go
- Swapping should only work with a target, not an empty spell
- quality of life: If you click on the portal and no enemies remain, then auto move there
- Refactor, card UI reconciliation algorithm is slow
- Swap can have unexpected effects if the aoe swap targets overlap with the caster original location, units may end up in an unexpected position, need batching to solve this
- How do players know what their upgrades are
- why do we keep accidentally ending our turns (force of habit with spacebar being used in auto chess?)
- You get "cannot move more than once per turn" while spell animations are firing
- Celebratory damage counter for huge combos!
- Event manager for granting dark card when you slay ally
- Bug: Verified, when I alt tab it desyncs
- Fix sometimes Game.playerTurnIndex is out of sync
  - Maybe this happened because I was alt-tabbed when he took his turn
- Fix replay?
  - This should be easy now that onDataQueue has been restored
- Taunt totem
- Tile effects
  - Lava
  - Tree
  - Burn
  - Poison
