- Does pathing information persist after save/load?
- Potential problem where I killed snowpack and left 2 tabs open (and left wsPie open) and my browser was really struggling to load homedepot.com
- Mana steal shows that it costs 20 mana when it should be free
- Rachels screen was too small and the cards overlapped the grid
- "Mind control" spell, changes their faction temporarily?
- Protection doesn't SHOW target being removed because target drawing is additive right now
- Bug: Loading doesn't work if clientIds have changed reassigning clientIds
- Frozen players can still cast, they just can't move
  - This might be resolved once I remove the ability to take turns simultaneously
- Rachel's Feedback
  - Multiplayer is awesome
  - She loves stacking the spells
  - Upgrades are a good way to balance the harder levels
  - Doesn't see the point of lance
    - Should it work diagonally?
  - Slay the Spire style chests
  - Make board bigger for more players?
  - Two stage levels? Pull a lever to reveal a portal
    - trap doors? Environmental interactions
      - Blow up a square to make it lava
  - Only start timelimit if 2 of 3 players have ended their turn
  - see save('cannotmovehere'), i couldn't move directly to my right or left after i killed the guy to my left, also one of the grunts wasn't moving
- how to set pixi resolution?
- Heavily test auto reconnect when pie gets disconnected
  - Prevent user input while reconnecting?
  - Will it support reconnecting multiple players if the whole server goes down?
- Could I do without the external port checker and check from the current client via the external ip?
- should unit.die cause player turn to end?
  - or is it fine that this is handled after castCards?
- Should ending turn always go over the network to prevent desyncs?
- A way to change sprite without interrupting animations midway?
  - For example: This occurs when a unit dies while it's attacking
- Rachel request: Support click and drag for queued cards
- Brad request: Allow keybind customization
- What about a prisoner AI that you can unleash, or traps that you can unlease in a line
- keybinding common spells
- What's to stop player from just bumming around to get extra cards via turnsPerCard?
  - Maybe only as long as there are enemies alive? Or set a hand max?
  - Or just make sure the enemies are hard enough that killing time is dangerous, also since cards now reset between levels this may not be a problem
- Maybe refactor how setWalkableAt works rather than doing it piece-meal, doing it all at once, once the grid is needed? to prevent bugs where a cell will appear walkable but wont be because some odd state left it as false walkable instead of true walkable
- After I disconnected, I closed my browser, rejoined, Brad's player was stuck between two cells and i joined as a new player instead of the old
  - Make loading occur only after animations are done
- It's possible that summoner could block you from finishing the level by summoning too many allies
- enemies should not be able to be on the portal
- Convert console.error(s) to Sentry.captureException?? before deployment?
- let our faction go before enemy units go
- How to best handle not being able to find a random empty cell? This can mess up things like entering a portal
  - see all `if(coords){...}` or all calls to `getRandomEmptyCell`
- Swapping should only work with a target, not an empty spell
- is removing units when their bones ~~take damage~~ are stepped on a footgun? See Unit.ts: `window.underworld.units = window.underworld.units.filter((u) => u !== unit);`
- quality of life: If you click on the portal and no enemies remain, then auto move there
- Player can still move after freezing themselves on during their turn
- "level 1" text never appears on load
- Refactor, card UI reconciliation algorithm is slow
- corpse image doesn't save when a game is loaded and a unit is dead
  - textures should be saved using pixi sprite texture cache instead of this.imageName
- Swap can have unexpected effects if the aoe swap targets overlap with the caster original location, units may end up in an unexpected position, need batching to solve this
- How do players know what their upgrades are
- notify which players have left to upgrade
- why do we keep accidentally ending our turns (force of habit with spacebar being used in auto chess?)
- You get "cannot move more than once per turn" while spell animations are firing
- Celebratory damage counter for huge combos!
- Event manager for granting dark card when you slay ally
- Number keys to queue up spells

- Bug: Verified, when I alt tab it desyncs

- Fix sometimes Game.playerTurnIndex is out of sync

  - Maybe this happened because I was alt-tabbed when he took his turn

- Fix replay?

  - This should be easy now that onDataQueue has been restored

- Taunt totem
- Tile effects
  - Lava
  - Tree
  - Burn
  - Poison
