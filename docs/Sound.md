- Contractor pitch
    Hello, I'm making a video game and am interested in hiring someone to make sound effects to match the animations. Can you tell me about your creation process?  My game is contains magic and monsters so the SFX will focus primarily on magical sounds, physical impacts, and some creature noises.
