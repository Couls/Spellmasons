## Sound Still Needed
- Logo reveal sfx
- sounds that lets you know everyone is waiting on you
- opening inventory (opening old book sound)
- UI SFX: Deny / Warnings: out of stamina, no target, out of range
- UI SFX: Click
- a "you died"/"game over" sound effect

- From Jake: Need UI sound interactions
    - Think of warcraft 3 frozen throne
    - **not** for hover states
