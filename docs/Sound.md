    - Think of warcraft 3 frozen throne
    - **not** for hover states
    - button clicks
    - left click
    - spells
    - book opening for inventory
    - a "you died" (gta wasted)
    - quieter end turn in multiplayer
    - sounds that lets you know everyone is waiting on you
    - warnings: out of stamina, no target, out of range (see breath of the wild)
    - missing sfx for vulnerable/debilitate
    - summoner cast sfx
    - missing vampire hurt noise (when you push them into lava)
