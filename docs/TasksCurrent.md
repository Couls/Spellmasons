## Current Priorities
- Fix turn taking / Pathfinding
    - // TODO: Fix resolvedone moving so that it only resolved when the unit is FINISHED moving
    - // TODO: Enforce max move distance (with pathing in mind)
    - Handle invalid paths so unit x,y doesn't get set to NaN.
    - Shift path when collision occurs so we don't get units orbiting each other?
- Make what's happening more obvious

- ownCharacterMarker disappears after movement? or after sync?
- Setup Buffer with social medias and start a following

Finish Content:
- More spells:
    - Haste modifier lets you move farther
    - Spells that summon walls or pillars to prevent enemy movement (maybe to trap them)
    - Push spells
        - If you push a unit into a portal they appear in the next level
    - Fix charge, stomp, lance
        - Movement spells could help you cast farther than you should be able to and move a far unit into another group and chain them, cause it should keep the target after they move
    - A card that changes mana cost of spells to health cost (vampire)
    - soul swap (swap bodies with another unit, until they die, then you return to your own body - and you get their abilities as cards)
