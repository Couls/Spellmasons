# Game Breaking Priorities
- Fix multiplayer
    - Experienced a bug where one player portaled on one screen but not on the other
    - Bug where one unit got into the game and the other is left looking at blank screen
- Upgrade bug where you click more than once and it triggers many levels to generate
    - Add a loading scrren
    - only allow one click

# Tasks
- Change portal to just a "go to upgrade" button
    - ~~Fix infinite stamina when you end level~~
- Unfreeze at end of turn, not beginning
- Make selected cards background transparent
- Improved level design with Wave Function Collapse
- Make freeze block pathing
- Improve unit MELEE attack prediction so it will only show exclamation if they will actually hit you
- Allow drag and drop between cards and far left or far right.
- Lerp in and out when WASD camera
- Prevent skipping levels by running to portal or swapping there
- Add labels to screens (upgrade, char select)

# Stale, but important bugs

- The zoom coordinates off issue between multiplayer sessions when casting
    - hit on one screen, miss on another
- Optimize pathing

# Juice
- Cards flip as you drag-n-drop over them
- Improved unit tooltip
