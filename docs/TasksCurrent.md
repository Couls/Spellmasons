## Current Priorities
- bug: while messing with forcing desync, player got stuck with red shader on
- Client joins network with id of "1" if they've been playing singleplayer and have that id saved
- Fix sycronize bugs. Make it more reliable
- Bug: You can swap into obstacles
- Dad:
    - Missing spell projection overlay
    - He got right click and left click mixed up
    - Heavy units aren't big anymore? or after sync?
    - Wants to know how far he's able to walk in one turn
    - Doesn't know what the circle means when clicking on enemies
    - Don't let me put more cards down than i can afford
- Make sure there is always a path to the portal
- Allow for restoring mana mid cast with something like mana steal
- Brad:
    - How to communicatge the extra cost that distance adds to mana
- todo: Make "mana cost" icon on cards allow for health cost (for spells such as mana steal)
    - Bug: Mana steal costs mana, it shouldn't!!
- Notify when waiting for other players to pick a character, just like "x players left to pick upgrade
- Fix UI so it never covers the gameboard

- wsPie: bug: what happens when you call sendData before joining a room???
---
- Bug: I got poisoned when I cast contageous poison but wasn't close
    - Task: Make contageous spread more obvious
- Task: Add bone dust pile that dead bodies turn into when hit.  No longer a unit (that can be interacted with), but still visible

Finish Content:
- More spells:
    - Haste modifier lets you move farther and slow
    - Spells that summon walls or pillars to prevent enemy movement (maybe to trap them)
    - Push spells (requires collisions)
        - If you push a unit into a portal they appear in the next level
    - Fix charge, stomp, lance
        - Movement spells could help you cast farther than you should be able to and move a far unit into another group and chain them, cause it should keep the target after they move
    - A card that changes mana cost of spells to health cost (vampire)
    - soul swap (swap bodies with another unit, until they die, then you return to your own body - and you get their abilities as cards)
    - Jake Ideas:
        - Magnetize (pull enemies together)
        - Reflect
        - Putting spells on the ground. DOTs, AOE fields
        - Debuffs
        - Explosive on an enemy and when he dies it procs
