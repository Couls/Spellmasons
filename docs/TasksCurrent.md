## Current Priorities
- bug: after portal sprite filter stops working??
- Fix turn taking / Pathfinding
    - Handle invalid paths so unit x,y doesn't get set to NaN.
    - Resolve collisions?
        - Prevent units from moving inside of each other without the orbiting effect if their target destination is inside of the other unit

- Setup Buffer with social medias and start a following
---
Finish Content:
- More spells:
    - Haste modifier lets you move farther and slow
    - Spells that summon walls or pillars to prevent enemy movement (maybe to trap them)
    - Push spells (requires collisions)
        - If you push a unit into a portal they appear in the next level
    - Fix charge, stomp, lance
        - Movement spells could help you cast farther than you should be able to and move a far unit into another group and chain them, cause it should keep the target after they move
    - A card that changes mana cost of spells to health cost (vampire)
    - soul swap (swap bodies with another unit, until they die, then you return to your own body - and you get their abilities as cards)
