## Current Priorities
- Add linesegment collisions to prevent archers from shooting through walls
- Prevent spawning inside of obstacles
- Add walls to whole map (and possibly rooms?)
---
- desync often happens with moveTarget since moveTarget can be set mid way through executing a gamestate_hash check which would make the hashes not equal
- Update server to send message number so clients can know when they both have the latest message.  This'll prevent false positive desync detection
---
- Cards become more expensive when you use them
- Playtest with friends
    - Verify gamestate integrity between clients
- Implement new way of getting cards over time
  - You shouldn't start with a bunch of cards
- Balance mana
  - To make this challenging, players should often be on the verge of no mana, it should feel scarce so they have to pick carefully what spells they want to use.
    - Maybe the answer to this is to make spells more expensive every time you use them
- Playtest with brad
- Security
    - Since I'm using electron, I should evaluate my dependencies for safety: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#security-is-everyones-responsibility
    - [Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#checklist-security-recommendations)
- Polish
    - [Add Juice](https://itch.io/b/1219/gamedev-pro)
        - (M) Animate cards

            - Use transform3d functions to trigger hardware acceleration: "In essence, any transform that has a 3D operation as one of its functions will trigger hardware compositing, even when the actual transform is 2D, or not doing anything at all (such as translate3d(0,0,0)). Note this is just current behaviour, and could change in the future (which is why we donâ€™t document or encourage it). But it is very helpful in some situations and can significantly improve redraw performance."
        - (L) Add shaders (see branch "shaders-yay")
        - (VERY OPTIONAL) Some kind of visible error mechanism to show when cards don't apply
            - Don't let players cast fizzle spells (AOE or chain without damage)
            - Like if you cast "Protection" on yourself and then AOE it does nothing because there are no targets to AOE off of
            - Or if you cast cards out of order like Dicard without a card after it
    - Finish all TODOs
    - Tutorial (Mario style, don't make it explicit)
    - SFX
        - Special sfx for when ally dies
- Hire Out?
    - Art
        - Calculate the value of your time for making art and music yourself vs the cost of hiring at $3000 expenses / month.  I'm -$18.75 per working hour
    - Music
        - Stina offered
        - Have special music for intense moments (low health, boss fight)

- Menus / Options
- Publicity
    - Publish on Steamworks
    - Social Media stuff
## Small Content Changes
- Spell: Burn mana / Steal mana
- Swap should only swap with targets, it shouldn't allow arbitrary teleportation
- swapping with portal shouldn't make user portal
- Spells that summon walls or pillars to prevent enemy movement (maybe to trap them)
## Large Changes
- (M) Push spells
  - Depends on: Collision task
  - Rework movement spells such as charge and stomp
