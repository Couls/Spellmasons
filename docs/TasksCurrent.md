## Current Priorities
- If i have someone selected and click off it should deselect
- Way to see how much mana a card costs without clicking on it
- Need pathfinding so you can't just hide and get all your mana back
- Chain needs a radius to show how far away chaining will occur, maybe
- Movement spells could help you cast farther than you should be able to and move a far unit into another group and chain them, cause it should keep the target after they move
- I wish i could bring goons with me through the portal
- Clone caused guys to spawn out of bounds
- Animating golem attack causes it to change z-index; or maybe clones of brad's player unit is turning into an attack golem and attacking
- Chaining too many units crashed the game
- If there are too many units they can stutter their position and it gets stuck on NPC turn cause they don't resolve the move promise; add a timeout to the move promise
- comments on mana:  there's too many times where i run out of mana and have to run around until it gets back
- Chain clone is too cheap
- UI issue where top yellow bar didn't render and the whole UI was messed up and there was a space at the bottom of the canvas
