## Critical Tasks
- Fix sycronize bugs. Make it more reliable
- Make sure there is always a path to the portal
- Fix UI so it never covers the gameboard, see stash "camera tests"
## Current Priorities
- Task: Make contageous spread more obvious
- Allow for restoring mana mid cast with something like mana steal
    - Take mana as each card is cast, not all at the beginning
- Client joins network with id of "1" if they've been playing singleplayer and have that id saved
- Bug: You can swap into obstacles
- Dad:
    - Missing spell projection overlay
    - He got right click and left click mixed up
    - Wants to know how far he's able to walk in one turn
    - Doesn't know what the circle means when clicking on enemies
    - Don't let me put more cards down than i can afford
- Brad:
    - How to communicatge the extra cost that distance adds to mana
- Notify when waiting for other players to pick a character, just like "x players left to pick upgrade

    - Push spells (requires collisions)
        - If you push a unit into a portal they appear in the next level

        - Movement spells could help you cast farther than you should be able to and move a far unit into another group and chain them, cause it should keep the target after they move
    - A card that changes mana cost of spells to health cost (vampire)
    - soul swap (swap bodies with another unit, until they die, then you return to your own body - and you get their abilities as cards)
