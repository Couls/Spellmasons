## Current Priorities
- Make alpha video
- Reach out to Stina for music


---
- Need pathfinding so you can't just hide and get all your mana back
- Chain needs a radius to show how far away chaining will occur, maybe
- Clone caused guys to spawn out of bounds
- If there are too many units they can stutter their position and it gets stuck on NPC turn cause they don't resolve the move promise; add a timeout to the move promise
- comments on mana:  there's too many times where i run out of mana and have to run around until it gets back
