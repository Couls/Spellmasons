A few balance feedback items
Spells generally seem well costed for what they do.

However the following 3 from what ive seen could use some attention.

1) Poison at 20 mana seems rather steep for a 10 point DoT considering the other options on the table. I would either lower the mana cost to 15 or 10, or increase the damage.

2) Contaminate seems very steep at 50 mana for spreading debuffs, considering the wealth of 20 point targetting spells. I would consider lowering it's cost

3) Targetting Column. Its to narrow and short at 20 mana compared to Cone, Connect, Circle, and other targetting spells at the same mana cost. Either reduce its cost to 15 or increase it's width and/or preferably length (cone is both wider and longer than column for example)

That's it. Noticed some UI/refresh bugs I might also report if they haven't been brought up yet.

Having a lot of fun so far!
