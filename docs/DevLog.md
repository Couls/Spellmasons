Figuring out cast range exceptions for arrows:
- arrow + another spell: allow cast out of range but remove click target if out of range for following spell
- only allow casting out of range if arrow is first spell and if arrow is first spell remove the click target if out of range
- target arrow + slash + target circle + slash incorrectly allows casting out of range if the target arrow is intercepted the target circle still appears at the cast location

Modding
I think I'll create a public github repo that has the typing files in it.  When the player builds their mod they'll have to copy the output to a mods/ file.  Then the electron app can scan that directory and add a `<script>` tag pointing to it to the HTML if they enable it.

To publish the mod they can open a PR and I can add it to the game.  In this way servers can use the mods too.

When creating spells note that state.casterUnit is a prediction unit and you cannot test equality like `state.casterUnit == therealunit`. Instead, compare ids

Electron - only using `package` not `make`
My findings show that electron is smart enough to not remake the exe (or have the contents different).  I made a branch in the `Golems-Electron-Build` repo called `executable` where I commit the out/Spellmasons-win32-x64 files and whenever I make a new build I can see which files change which should impact how Steam handles the update

Better Perks

Perks need to be randomly generated
Attributes: healthmax, manamax, staminamax, range, health, mana, stamina, chances of things happening
When: Immediately, Every Level, Every Turn
Amount: Lots, Medium, A little
Certainty: yes, %
Type: Perk, Curse

Pairings:
Group 1:
  Attributes: max stats / range
  When: Immediately (amount lots, certainty yes), Every Level (amount medium, certainty yes), Every Turn (amount little, certainty %)
Group 2:
  Attributes: temporary stats
  When: Every Level, Every Turn
  Certainty: %

Examples:
```
% chance at the start of every turn to get x attribute changed
```

I'm now confused about the updates.  There's 2 folders that comes out of an electron-forge make.  One is make/squirrel.windows/x64 which is the installer that puts the files in local appData and the other is Spellmasons-win32-x64 which seems to just be the exe (not the installer).  If I ship that via steam I can have steam manage the updates I think and it'll do delta updates.
Okay, so it looks like the `Package` step makes the executable and the `Make` step makes an installer (so that you can distribute a single file rather than a folder with the executable and all it's associated files).  So I think I just need to run `Package` and distribute that through steam and I can skip all the installer stuff. [as i suspected](https://www.electronforge.io/core-concepts/build-lifecycle) and make step is what puts files in out/make which is where all the squirrel stuff / installer is, but since I'm distributing via Steam I don't need that.

Issues with current trailer:
  - Cold open isn't UMPHY enough
  - 2nd scene has too much deadspace
  - Doesn't explain what's special about the game
  - Scene 4 waits too long before player casts

Brad feedback for Gameplay trailer

### Plan for updates
  - How to handle updates:
      - Every release should make a manefest and a bunch of assets (.js, .css, .png, .mp3, etc) available on the static site.
      - On every boot of the game it requests the manifest (which should be super quick). (make sure it never caches)
      - If the request fails or timesout (no network, etc), just run the local version of the game
          - Give a button to manually update, maybe it's just a super slow network and they should be able to manually update if they are behind version
      - Once it has the manifest, it then compares the version numbers, if the manifest has a greater version number it downloads all the assets in the manifest.
          - If full download is successful it replaces all the local assets and runs the game
          - if it's not, report the failure and run the game with the previous assets
      - In this way, delta updates are possible, the user wont have to "restart to get updates" and it will work offline.

- game files install to: C:\Users\Jordan\AppData\Local\spellmasons
- steam files download to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spellmasons
**Solving efficient updates**
- Requirements:
  1. it should work regardless of where a user's steam install directory is
  2. it should work on first run of the game, not needing a restart after downloading an update triggered by first run
- Options:
  - Pushing updates through Steam
    - This doesn't work well because Squirrel installs the game files in a different directory than the steam install directory and it's difficult to determine where the steam install directory is so communicating between those directories would be unreliable
  - Using Hazel or other build in electron update
    - This appears to require installing the entire app every time an update is pushed
    - This requires a restart after the update is installed so it doesn't support requirement #2
  - Having electron just render play.spellmasons.com
    - This would work like a regular website and so long as I have cache busting set up right it will satisfy both requirements.  The disadvantage is that an old version will be stored on steam perminantly and users will have to have an internet connection when the boot up the game in order to get the latest update

**Boss Design**
Every turn the boss creates a red portal and will teleport to it next turn.
The boss's regular casts are
  - Summon
  - AOE damage
  - Cannot be frozen?

- When you start the level there is only a few red portals
- Stepping on one does damage to you
- One of them becomes the bossmason
- Other's become goons

- (attack logic should occur in getUnitAttackTargets so it manages attentionmarker visibility)
- Make sure red portals transfer any curses or modifiers to the units that spawn into them

---
The more "advance notice" the players get the more interesting the boss is because they can react to it.
So if you know where he's going to teleport a full turn before you can prepare for it.  If you know what mobs he's gunna consume you can interact with them or change them.
Maybe the boss could be a larger, eviler spellmason.  Maybe with emanating particles.  He could teleport, spawn red portals that are linked to each other, summon guys.

Boss aesthetic: Desaturated spellmason with eminating purple particles
Abilities: 
  - Consume NPCs to grow stronger
    - use "mana trail" like particles but make it a health trail
  - Can teleport but broadcasts teleport location one turn early.
    - the broadcast portal should be interactable
  - boss visual progression: Evolving not just changing.  Research Dragonballz
  - Can resurrect allies
  - Can spawn "pickups" / red portals
    - red portals take you to the another red portal and disappears after use
      - maybe they hurt you when you go through them?
  - Set fires that spread

Working on dynamically loading js to ensure that the steam install stays small for updates.
Turns out that the exe output by Squirrel is actually just an installer, not the game's exe.
Once installed, the game exe is placed `C:\Users\Jordan\AppData\Local\spellmasons\app-1.0.0`
as well as all the javascript and assets that it runs.  So you can either load javascript via 
Electron relative to the exe (the game not the installer) path like so:
```js
  // Load javascript
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync('testDynamicImport.js', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log('Electron: javascript', fileContents);
  mainWindow.webContents.executeJavaScript(fileContents);
```
or you can put the js in `C:\Users\Jordan\AppData\Local\spellmasons\app-1.0.0\resources\app\src\build` and load it from js like so:
```js
// Dynamically import game scripts:
for (let url of ['./testDynamicImport2.js']) {
    console.log('Experiment: Attempting to import 2', url);
    const script = document.createElement("script");  // create a script DOM node
    script.src = url;  // set its src to the provided URL
    document.head.appendChild(script);
}
```

- Use transform3d functions to trigger hardware acceleration: "In essence, any transform that has a 3D operation as one of its functions will trigger hardware compositing, even when the actual transform is 2D, or not doing anything at all (such as translate3d(0,0,0)). Note this is just current behaviour, and could change in the future (which is why we donâ€™t document or encourage it). But it is very helpful in some situations and can significantly improve redraw performance."

### Blue Ocean Principle
The primary unique driver behind Spellmasons is creativity in spellcasting.  So don't get distracted by all sorts of other things like upgrades and other roguelite elements.  Focus on making the spellcasting superb!

Around 3 weeks of serious development into the project (around 3 montsh total) and I had the first day where I actually had a lot of fun with it!
Brad and I played for about 20 minutes and had a great time. I think this could really turn into a good game!

To show original tiles:
1. ensure at least one player spawn is returned so it doesn't loop forever
2. Comment out "// Change all remaining base tiles to final tiles" section

The pathing only requires being inside an inverted poly if there is a single inverted poly anywhere, if there are none, it works fine with just
regular polys

I have 8 working days until Erin and I leave on our June Trip.  By that time I think the game will be in a very good state. Major tasks I'll have done:
- Map Generation
- Liquid interaction
- New Spell Toolbar
- Stand alone server
- Server browser
- Better Menu
